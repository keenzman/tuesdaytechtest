Design all tests to be independent from one another. It is essential to be able to launch every test independently of other tests.

Integrate all tests with the CI/CD pipeline. The ideal QA process in a company should be automated in such a way that every change in the code is tested automatically as a part of the CI setup before the changes are deployed into production.

Write requirements that can be easily converted into testing scenarios using BDD.

Do your best to gather every piece of evidence that will help to fix bugs. Screenshots andÂ screencasts for failed tests are a good example here. Adding them do the test logs will definitely make your life easier when you investigate a possible cause of a test failure and try to fix it.
